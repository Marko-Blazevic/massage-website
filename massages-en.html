        <h3>Holistic Massage</h3>
        <p>
          When working from a Holistic perspective, the body is viewed as a reflection of the whole person and all of
          their
          lived experiences. The body is the "home" of the emotions, belief systems and the expressions of the spirit,
          and as such
          we must respect it. Every time we experience something stressful, mentally demanding or emotionally exhausting
          situation, our body remembers it and stores it. For this reason, after a certain amount of time, we begin to
          feel
          tensions and discomfort. That is the body which sends us a message that we should change something in our
          life. The Holistic
          approach to the massage basically represents the understanding that a person is much more than a body and that
          complexity and
          the beauty of each of us consists of many factors. All these parts of us are in the direct connection with our
          body and
          the way we feel about it (do we feel fantastic, flexible and extremely mobile or something
          hurts, we are stiff, we have a problem), and because of this, different techniques (traditional, therapeutic,
          shiatsu, Lymphatic Drainage Massage, reflexology, work with subtle
          energies...) are used when applying holistic treatment and massage
          which achieves deep relaxation of the organism on a physical, emotional and mental level.
          The Holistic massage quickly improves the quality of sleep and concentration, improves blood and lymph
          circulation in the body and the elimination of toxins in the body, and ailments caused by stress and bad
          lifestyle habits are alleviated. Holistic
          massage can alleviate or completely restore the lost balance in the body.

        <h3>Anticellulite Massage</h3>
        <p class="slide-up">
          Anti-cellulite massage is one of the most effective methods for removing cellulite from sensitive regions on
          the body. Anti-cellulite massage significantly improves circulation in the treated parts of the body and thus
          the body
          releases toxins accumulated in fat cells, tightens and rejuvenates the skin, i.e. restores its tone and
          elasticity.
          This is a type of intensive massage in which a combination of special massage techniques of kneading,
          draining,
          tapping, twisting, visibly improves the condition and the appearance of body regions that requires it.
          Anticellulite massage
          especially helps those parts of the body that are hard to be affected by exercise, such as the inner side of
          the knees or
          the upper outer part of the thighs.
          <br />
          Anti-cellulite treatments are started immediately after the end of the monthly cycle, because then, in the
